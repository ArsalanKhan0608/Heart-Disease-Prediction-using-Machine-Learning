# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Heart Disease (including Coronary Heart Disease, Hypertension, and Stroke) remains one of the top
causes of death in the US. The Heart Disease and Stroke Statisticsâ€”2019 Update from the **American Heart Association** indicates that:
* 116.4 million, or 46% of US adults are estimated to have hypertension. These are findings related to the new 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines.
* On average, someone dies of Cardiovascular disease(CVD) every 38 seconds. About 2,303 deaths from CVD each day, based on 2016 data.
* On average, someone dies of a stroke every 3.70 minutes. About 389.4 deaths from stroke each day, based on 2016 data.

In this Project, I will unleash useful insights using heart disease datasets and by building a stacked ensemble model by combining the power of best-performing machine learning algorithms.
